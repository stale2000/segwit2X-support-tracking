INITIAL OUTLINE DOCUMENT, NOT EVEN CLOSE TO DONE.  Will be updating this with the real evidence over the next couple days.

# segwit2X-support-tracking
This will track Granular levels of support, non-support, and non-commitmental opinions from bitcoin companies on Segwit2X.  

Many bitcoin companies have been silent on their support or non-support of segwit2X.  This document is an attempt by me, to gather evidence, either through public statements, or by contacting the company directly through their support channels.

Much of the original research that I have done, is by privately emailing companies.  I will be including screenshots of the email correspondence.  Readers should be aware that, obviously, screenshots of emails can be easily faked, customer support channels can be wrong, and that companies can change their minds.

I offer only my word that I have made a good faith effort to gather this evidence.

#### New York Agreement Subsidiaries 
These are companies or products that are owned by NYA participants, and are therefore also segwit2X supporters.

To be included in this section, there must be evidence that a company/product is owned by a NYA participant.
- [BCoin](http://bcoin.io/) - BCoin was created by Purse.io, a NYA signer -"Copyright bcoin.io, Purse, 2017, All Rights Reserved."  
- [coins.co.th](https://imgur.com/a/fCofx) - "both Coins.co.th and Coins.ph are prepared to handle such changes and to implement this capacity increase" 

### Segwit2X Supporters

- [btc pop](https://blog.btcpop.co/2017/07/19/preparation-for-hard-forks/) - "Therefore, Btcpop will support all competing forms of Bitcoin and grant each option to our users."

### Will Follow the Hashpower
These companies have stated that they will follow the majority of the hashpower.  Currently, segwit2X has >90% of the hashpower signalling support, so this means that these companies will implement segwit2X, if nothing changes.
- [Bitsewa](https://imgur.com/a/6Nrwx) - "we go by the rule of longest chain with the most hashpower.  If majority successfully works on activating segwit2X, then we fully support that"
- [Breadwallet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6sii2c/70_bitcoin_companies_exchange_and_wallets_that/dld38x3/) - "Breadwallet follows the majority of hashing power on the original PoW algorithm, segwit2x or no"
- [Bitcoin.co.id](https://imgur.com/a/WtB8N) "we have not released any press release yet regarding the Segwit2x activation. We usually follow the majority of the hashpower"
- [Cubits](https://imgur.com/a/qkeIz)  - "We will update our software and follow the main chain of Bitcoin."
- [Gemini](https://gemini.com/blog/information-related-to-geminis-policy-on-an-upcoming-chain-split/) - "The “BTC” balance and trading activity you see on Gemini will likely reflect the chain with the greater total difficulty."
- [Kraken](https://blog.kraken.com/post/1150/bitcoin-cash-and-a-critical-alert-for-bitcoin-margin-traders/) - " the vast majority of the Bitcoin community remaining on the chain that activates Segregated Witness and, later on, a possible increase to 2MB blocks."

#### Emergent Consensus Supporters
These are the companies that haven't explicitly stated support for segwit2X yet, but HAVE come out in favor of Emergent Consensus, some time in the past.  This means that they are almost certainly supporters of segwit2X as well.  


### Non-committal
These companies are aware of segwit2X but have explicity refused to state whether they will support it or will not support it.
- [Bitt](https://imgur.com/a/t1t3N) - "We are following the landscape closely, but can't give official word at this time."
- [CoinCorner](https://imgur.com/a/oESKJ) - "we will make an announcement to our clients in due course."
- [itBit](https://imgur.com/a/5mqR5) - "We haven’t stated any particular policy with regards to Segwit2x."
- [MaiCoin](https://imgur.com/a/edh4H) - "At this moment we have not decided on whether we will support Segwit2x."
- [BuyABitcoin](https://imgur.com/a/WysZD) - " It is currently too early to have a solid decision on our stance with this. We are definitely interested in providing our service on the chain that is the most popular to our customer base "
- [zebpay](https://imgur.com/a/tC2Gr) - "We are aware of this and will take care as required as the situation develops."

### No Segwit2X
These companies are opposed to segwit2X

### Bitcoin Core

- [FoxBit](https://imgur.com/a/006zV) "We support Bitcoin Core"
-
