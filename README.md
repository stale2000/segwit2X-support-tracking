INITIAL OUTLINE DOCUMENT, NOT EVEN CLOSE TO DONE.  Will be updating this with the real evidence over the next couple days.

# segwit2X-support-tracking
This will track Granular levels of support, non-support, and non-commitmental opinions from bitcoin companies on Segwit2X.  

Many bitcoin companies have been silent on their support or non-support of segwit2X.  This document is an attempt by me, to gather evidence, either through public statements, or by contacting the company directly through their support channels.

Much of the original research that I have done, is by privately emailing companies.  I will be including screenshots of the email correspondence.  Readers should be aware that, obviously, screenshots of emails can be easily faked, customer support channels can be wrong, and that companies can change their minds.

I offer only my word that I have made a good faith effort to gather this evidence.

#### New York Agreement Subsidiaries 
These are companies or products that are owned by NYA participants, and are therefore also segwit2X supporters.

To be included in this section, there must be evidence that a company/product is owned by a NYA participant.

### Segwit2X Supporters or Will Follow Hashpower
These companies have either stated support for segwit2X or for following the majority of the hashpower.  These two are grouped together because 90% of the hashpower is currently supporting segwit2X.

#### Emergent Consensus Supporters
These are the companies that haven't explicitly stated support for segwit2X yet, but HAVE come out in favor of Emergent Consensus, some time in the past.  This means that they are almost certainly supporters of segwit2X as well.  


### Non-committal
These companies are aware of segwit2X but have explicity refused to state whether they will support it or will not support it.

### No Segwit2X / Bitcoin Core
The companies are either opposed to segwit2X, or have stated that they will follow Bitcoin Core (which is currently strongly opposed to segwit2X).

### Unknown
These are companies which I do not currently have any evidence of what they support or do not support as it directly relates to segwit2X.
